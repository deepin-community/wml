wml (2.0.11ds2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The embedded code copy of txt2html (beyond others) has been removed.
  From now on, wml no more chooses between the embedded code copy and
  Debian's txt2html package based on the parameters given to
  &wml_fmt_text() and always uses Debian's txt2html package.

  The package txt2html is still only Recommended since it's not strictly
  necessary for wml usage. It is only needed if the module wml::fmt::text
  is used. The man page wml_aux_txt2html has been removed, too, instead of
  symlinked to the txt2html man page, because otherwise the Recommendation
  would have to be upgraded to a strict Dependency. See the
  wml::fmt::text(3) man page for the usage of txt2html from within WML.
