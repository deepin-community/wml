Comment:
 The files wml_docs/wml_std_*.txt and wml_docs/wml_barebone.txt have
 been removed because their licences do not meet the Debian Free
 Software Guidelines.
 .
 And since the upstream tar ball contains quite a lot of embedded code
 copies not used by Debian, all files not necessary for building the
 Debian package have been removed for the repackaged upstream tar ball,
 too.
 .
 See the file COPYRIGHT.OTHER in the source package for the copyrights
 and licenses of the removed parts as mentioned above.
Files-Excluded:
 wml_docs/wml_barebone.txt
 wml_aux/freetable
 wml_aux/iselect
 wml_backend/p2_mp4h
 wml_backend/p3_eperl
