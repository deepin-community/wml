    use it.
  * Do no more use the embedded code copy of txt2html (Closes: #576522)

  * Moved from using the embedded libgd copy to using and depending on

  * Overhauled debian/rules
    - Added configure target
    - Moved copying of config.{sub,guess} to configure target, made it

       /usr/doc/wml -> /usr/share/doc/wml switch.
  * [debian/rules]: Uses dh_perl to generate perl dependency instead of
      hard-coding it in debian/control.  (Thanks Raphaël!  :-)
  * [debian/control]: Updated dependencies to the perl-5.005-compliant
      versions of eperl, libgd-perl, and wwwtable.

wml (1.4.9-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream non-maintainer release.
  * /etc/global.weblintrc is no longer installed as a conffile.  Please refer
    to README.Debian for more information.  (Thanks to Christian Leutloff
    <leutloff@sundancer.oche.de> for the wake-up call.  :)
  * Modified /usr/bin/wml because the /usr/bin/wml_p9_slice's verbose option
    had been changed from "-x" to "-v".
  * Added "slices" attribute to <page> in the /usr/doc/wml/examples/demo.wml
    to force the creation of the WML_PAGE_XXX slices, otherwise the example
    won't build in WML 1.4.9.  You might need to make similar changes to
    your *.wml files too if they fail to build with this new WML.  Read
    /usr/doc/wml/changelog.gz for more information.
  * No longer rm /usr/man/cat1/wml_*.  All WML documentation, including
    "non-manpage manpages", should now be accessible with /usr/bin/wmd.
  * Added wmd.postinst to run mandb to ensure that man can find the manpages
    under /usr/man/cat1.

wml (1.4.8-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream non-maintainer release.

     - Recommends: iselect (>= 1.0.3-1), weblint (>= 1.020-1)
     - Suggests: gfont
  * debian/rules: Replaced some files with symlinks to iselect and weblint.
  * Added new debian/conffiles with the file "/etc/global.weblintrc".
    It could be problematic if weblint's maintainer decides to conffile
    it in the future, but that hasn't happened yet, so everything should be
    fine for now.  <grin>
  * Added the new /usr/doc/wml/SUPPORT from upstream.
  * Commented out a few lines in ./Makefile.in, ./configure and
    config/configure.in to save package build time.
  * Closed Bug#13607 and Bug#15895.  They should have been fixed in recent
    non-maintainer releases.  If you find otherwise, feel free to re-open
    them.  <grin>

  * debian/control: Now Depends on perl (>= 5.004.04-3), m4 (>= 1.4-8) and
    eperl (>= 2.2.8-0.2).
  * debian/rules:
     - Removed --enable-compat from the command-line option of ./configure.
       We can live without the obsolete features, can't we?  <grin>
     - Replaced some files with symlinks to m4 and eperl.

wml (1.4.6-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream non-maintainer libc6 release.
  * debian/rules:
     - Now uses debhelper.
     - Added "INSTALLDIRS=perl" to "make install" to ensure the Perl modules
       are put into the correct directories.
  * debian/control: Updated Standards-Version to 2.3.0.1.
  * Other minor changes and fixes here and there.  <smile>

  * Known bug: WML fails to compile the demo files in /usr/doc/wml/examples
    and gives the error message "Error in Pass 3 (rc=139)".  Apparently,
    /usr/bin/wml_p3_eperl gives a segmentation fault and core dump at the
    end of Pass 3.  /usr/bin/eperl from the eperl_2.2.5-1.1 package (libc6)
    seems to have the same problem (Bug#15818).  Hmm...
